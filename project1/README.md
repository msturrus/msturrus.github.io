**Project 1**

    This project is going to be a choose-your-own adventure style game with a modestly branching storyline and least one minigame.  The story will be about the protagonist attempting to steal an historic space capsule from the Smithsonian.  I am not sure how long anything will take so I am going to build it out in phases.


**ESSENTIALS**
        I am going to build this first, in order to be sure to meet the project requirements by the deadline.  This will include the intro text, one minigame (navigating the smithsonian by clicking doors in a proper sequence, generated randomly at game start), and two ending outcomes (success/failure) based on successfully completing the minigame.  It will require linked html pages, extensive CSS, a manageable amount of JQuery/javascript, and a manageable amount of basic art assets.

    **ESSENTIALS +**
        This will add on to the essentials by adding story branches, determined by user's response to yes/no or multiple-choice prompts with an added random element.  This will add between 2 and 6 extra endings, for a total of 4-8.  Compared to ESSENTIALS, It will require more linked html pages, a small amount of added CSS, a small amount of added JQuery/javascript, and double the amount of art assets.

    **XTRA**
        This version will add 1-2 additional minigames for a total of 2-3.  These minigames and their outcomes would be incorporated into the extra story branches added in ESSENTIALS + and would replace some of the simple choices.  Compared to ESSENTIALS +, It will require a similar number of linked HTML pages, a large amount of added CSS, a large amount of added JQuery/javascript, and added art assets.
